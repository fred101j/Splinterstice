## Up For Grabs: Join the Splinterstice Project

### Gain Experiential Learning by Using Splinterstice to Teach Yourself Self-Hosting

### Description:
Splinterstice is a decentralized, web-based IM (instant messenger) designed to offer a safe haven for free speech, avoiding the pitfalls of centralized control and censorship. Its creation is a response to the need for private, secure communication channels that serve the niche online groups of hidden services on Tor and I2P that don't fall under the label of "dark-web" (anything explicitly illicit) or "deep-web" (anything solely for research purposes), whilst upholding quality discourse without interference from mainstream or centralized platforms, in the process.

### Getting Started:
New to Splinterstice? Begin by joining our official Matrix space at [Splinterstice Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#Splinterstice(official):matrix.org) to receive the 11-steps you'll need to follow to become Splinterstice's "head dev" (meaning primary host of Splinterstice, in this case).

### Some Of Our Current Opportunities:
- **Secure Registration System:** Develop and enhance the account registration system accessible only through Tor and I2P networks, ensuring a secure entry point for new users.
- **Customization Features:** Users are provided mass customization for their accounts all the way down to the look of their UI, to a large extent, allowing users to personalize their messaging experience within the bounds of robust security practices.
- **Accessibility and Integration:** Work on unconventional access methods, more specifically that involving the usage of what we call "key-codes" for accessing your account from both the clearnet and various darknets.
